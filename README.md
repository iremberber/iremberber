 Hi, I'm İrem, an Industrial Engineering student at Namık Kemal University in Turkey.
I have a background in web development with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Recently, I've started exploring Data Science and am excited to share my progress in this field.
Feel free to check out my GitHub to see my projects and follow along as I dive deeper into coding and data science.
